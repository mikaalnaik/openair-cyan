The educational experience might be the biggest way that Cyan units will combat climate change. One can quickly see what $CO_2$ emissions look like in trapped form, how much it weighs, and how long it takes to capture it. DACC starts to become a conversation point among friends and family. People start wanting to run Cyans to erase the emissions from their light bulbs, for example. And if they can neutralize those emissions, what’s next? Household emissions?

Keeping the electricity consumption low will ensure Cyan removes more $CO_2$ than it emits through electricity use. Cyan uses 1.5 watts of electricity to power the air pump which bubbles air through water and humidifies the calcium hydroxide, allowing $CO_2$ to be absorbed. However, the air pump does not need to be run continuously to maintain adequate humidification. A duty cycle of, say, 10 minutes on &amp; 50 minutes off is possible and suggested for negative emissions (more $CO_2$ removed than consumed by the air pump). The fan uses 3 watts but only needs to be run intermittently to refresh the air inside the box. The fan is also useful to speed up dry time but this is not essential for operation. If you’re going for negative emissions, air drying would really help unless you are using renewable energy to power your unit. ",

    "content": "Important: Optional - for Experimentation Only . The fan has two sides, each with four corners with anti-vibration foam pieces held in place by screws. The fan grilles are also held in place with these screws. The fan will blow air in the direction of back to front, so when we mount the fan on the side of the box, we expect it to pull air from inside and push it outside. We will use one of the fan grilles as a template for where to drill holes into the side of the box, as well as where to cut the circular hole that will let the air through. Disassemble the back of the fan to obtain just the grille by unscrewing the 4 screws at each corner. You will not need the anti-vibration foam piece at each corner for anything so those can be saved for other uses. Once you have the back grille off, center it on the short side of the box, just under the plastic handle. You can use optional neodymium magnets to hold the grille in place by putting one magnet on the outside and one on the inside of the plastic side wall. Next, score the plastic along the outermost circle on the grille with a box cutter blade. You may also decide to use a Sharpie to more clearly identify the hole to be cut. Instead of a box cutter blade, a small tooth reciprocating saw would be very helpful to avoid the initial breaks in the plastic caused by getting the hole started and widened. Once the hole is cut, on the inside, take the 4 screws and back grille from the fan and slip one of the safety grilles between the back grille and the fan blade. A safety grille should also be added between the front grille and fan blade as well. One is not shown in the image below and to the right for initial airflow considerations, but it is advisable if you might have small external objects that could find their way through the front grille and into the fan blade. For the input vent, repeat the hole-cutting process on the opposite side of the box from the fan, using the 8/32” screws and nuts provided with the safety grilles to add two safety grilles, one on the inside and one on the outside. The screws should face inward for best appearance. Here is a picture of the fan from the side. The input vent is on the opposite side. ",

You may wish to remove a few labels before placing the lid on top and placing the whole assembly within the Sterilite FlipTop box. Cut about 1 foot of air tubing (this may be too short for your needs, but ideal if you are locating the pump directly alongside the box). Attach the tubing to the pump, then attach the air stone to the other end of the tubing. The air stone is the blue porous ceramic object; air blows into the stone and finely diffuses through to create many small bubbles. Place the container inside the box. It should fit very nicely and effectively divide the space between the upper and lower halves of the box. Fill the box up to the level of the container lid with water. Allow the water to go into the container as well. The water level should be up to the top of the lid (the whole container should be submerged). Place the air stone so that it is on its side, alongside the submerged container. One of the back corners near the box’s hinge is a good place. You may wish to drill a hole in the lid to allow the air tubing to easily pass through. We did not find a hole necessary, as the lid can be snapped mostly shut with the air tubing in place. Place the 1 quart container lid on top of the hummus container lid. It will float in place and should not sink. This is shown below. When ready to do a run, you will add a coffee filter with the desired amount of $Ca(OH)_2$ onto the 1 quart container lid, close the box lid, then plug in the air pump and let it run for your desired amount of time (below). If you wish to speed up the drying process after you remove the coffee filter (i.e. to weigh the product and find out how much $CO_2$ you obtained), please go on to the next section, which is the box and fan assembly.

    "content": "Purpose: These are instructions to build an open hardware, DIY DACC unit for home or classroom use. Expected results: an up to 12.5% weight increase from $CO_2$ uptake over the course of a 16-hour period when starting with 10g input material. This translates into about a 2.1g $CO_2$ uptake obtainable during a single run. The average has been about 1.7g across multiple runs. Minimal parts cost: &lt;$20 for the basic system which consists of a humidifier box and air pump; about $100 to add the box and fan for experimentation (not necessary). Goal: The goal of this project was to build a high-efficiency, very low cost direct air carbon capture (DACC) system. We call the system Cyan in honor of Violet, OpenAir’s moisture swing sorbent DACC, and also in honor of cyanobacteria, whose combined efforts transformed the early Earth’s atmosphere. Similarly, we believe millions of distributed, consumer-scale DACC units could someday complement large-scale DACC efforts and make a difference when it comes to climate change. This unit will not solve the climate crisis alone, but many of these will open doors to discussion, education, behavior changes, modifications, and further R&amp;D to improve the state of DACC. And that is what we desperately need to limit the possibility of dangerous warming. ​ . ​ . ",

This reaction takes place naturally, especially in concrete, but typically takes a very long amount of time (months to years). Cyan speeds up the reaction considerably by increasing the relative humidity and forcing this “wet” air into the reaction chamber to offset $CO_2$ declines as the reaction progresses. Calcium carbonate ($CaCO_3$) is a safe output that is actually the main constituent of limestone. It can be extracted, filtered, dried, weighed, and the quantity of $CO_2$ taken up can be determined through calculation from the weight. No equipment is required to pressurize the captured $CO_2$, making Cyan a good choice for true consumer-scale DACC. ",

While bubbles of $CO_2$ were produced upon filtering, drying, and applying 5% distilled white vinegar (acid test for the presence of $CaCO_3$), it is very likely that not all the $Ca(OH)_2$ is converted to $CaCO_3$ in 24 hours. Thus we still need to quantify the amount of $CO_2$ that is captured per gram of $Ca(OH)_2$ to see how that depends on different variables. To achieve true negative emissions using Cyan, you will need to start with a source of carbon-neutral $Ca(OH)_2$. Hydrated lime is a good consumer source; it is very easy to buy hydrated lime at a gardening or hardware store. However, this hydrated lime comes from calcium oxide (lime) produced through calcination, a very energy-intensive process with temperatures above 900 degrees Celsius. This energy is typically supplied mostly by fossil fuels, though renewable sources are becoming increasingly prevalent in the energy mix. There are projects underway to produce lime through concentrated solar, but for now this is a one-way reaction to produce calcium carbonate without regenerating the lime. ",

    "content": "The coffee filter, plus product, should be thoroughly dried before weighing. Subtract the weight of the coffee filter and also the weight of the $ \\boldsymbol{Ca(OH)_2} $ that you added. That will give the amount of mass change that has taken place. This change in mass is equal to the grams of $ \\boldsymbol{CO_2} $ sequestered minus the grams of water that have evaporated. The carbonation reaction once again is $Ca(OH)_2+CO_2-&gt;CaCO_3+H_2O$. Since both sides of the equation must have the same mass (mass balance), the following must also be true: . change in mass = . $ x * (CaCO_3 M_r - Ca(OH)_2 M_r) = x * (100.0869g/mol - 74.09268g/mol) = x * 25.9942 $ . where $ x=molesCaCO_3 $ produced. It also follows that the grams of $ \\boldsymbol{CO_2} $ captured is $ x * CO_2 M_r = x * 44.0095g/mol $. Thus the change in mass that is measured must be scaled by a factor of $ 44.0095/25.9942=1.693 $ to obtain the actual amount of $CO_2$ taken up. Example: You have added 10.00g $ \\boldsymbol{Ca(OH)_2} $ to a coffee filter weighing 0.86g. The total initial weight is 10.86g. After your run, you measure the weight of the coffee filter + product of 12.11g. You subtract the weight of the coffee filter to get the weight of the product, which is $12.11g-0.86g=\\boldsymbol{11.25g}$. The mass change from final to initial time points is thus $11.25g-10.00g=\\boldsymbol{1.25g}$. You must then increase the mass change by a factor of 1.693 to get the weight of $CO_2$ taken up. This is $1.25g*1.693=\\boldsymbol{2.12g}$. The above was taken from the best experimental run so far. For approximately every 5x $Ca(OH)_2$ inputted, 1x $CO_2$ is taken up.
