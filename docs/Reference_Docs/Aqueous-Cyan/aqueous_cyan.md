# Aqueous Cyan (Beta)

The Aqueous Cyan is an experimental alternative version of the original Cyan.

![image](../../assets/images/aqueous_cyan_beta.png)

The Aqueous Cyan is a variation on the original Cyan that I have been experimenting with. As with all Cyan designs, the goal is to come up with a distributed direct-air carbon dioxide capture device that is efficient, cheap, and easy for non-technical people to build and operate.

As I am an electrical engineer, I welcome any comments or help from people from other fields, particularly chemistry, chemical engineering, and mechanical engineering. Some ideas are in the file "Welcome to Aqueous Cyan--Can you help.pdf", above.
