# About Us

## Philosophy

The [Resources](resources.md) section of this website includes some of my own notes (not all of them are polished) that I disclose for other people to use.
There, I hope you may find something useful to you.

I advocate the [Open Source model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model).
This is why I strive to make my work open to other people for consultation, replication and reuse.
