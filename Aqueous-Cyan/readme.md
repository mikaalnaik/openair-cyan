# Aqueous Cyan (Beta)
The Aqueous Cyan is an experimental alternative version of the original Cyan.

The Aqueous Cyan is a variation on the original Cyan that I have been experimenting with. As with all Cyan designs, the goal is to come up with a distributed direct-air carbon dioxide capture device that is efficient, cheap, and easy for non-technical people to build and operate.

As I am an electrical engineer, I welcome any comments or help from people from other fields, particulary chemistry, chemical engineering, and mechanical engineering.
